1. Retrieve quaternion data for a particular person, for 7 sensors

Subject 2, Session 1,
Static = 2
Walk = 8,9,10,11,12
Squat = 5
Jump = 6

Static = 17
Walk = 20,21,22,23,24
Squat = 18
Jump = 19

l = length(tree.subject.frames.frame);
for i = 3:l
a(i,5:8) = tree.subject.frames.frame(i).sensorOrientation(1:4)
end

b = a(3:end,1:4)

I have done the above code using extractDataFromMvnx.m file.

Also, I have used that into, modified_UseFunction_Data_Mohammad_Test.m to test the code.

Now need to update main.m to:

take two csv file as input (static and dynamic - 7 sensor quaternions)
output a csv file with joint angles - 3 joints, 2,3 planes, for each side
